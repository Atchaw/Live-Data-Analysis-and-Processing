## Goals : 

A tool to create engagement by processing in real time a keynote livestream to make content for social networks.

## State of the art : 

“Ok google”, “Say Siri”, “Cortana”, …

## Drawbacks :
- Context more noisy (Harder to extract useful information)
- More than one keyword
- More than one speaker, with a variety accents
* Indirect approach (We don’t listen to the speaker, but to a live recording of them)

## Why using this tool ?

- Attract new viewers, create more interactions in online keynotes
- Trying to stay relevant in the age of social networks
- Challenge the constraints of social distancing
