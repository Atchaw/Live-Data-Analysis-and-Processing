# Live-Data-Analysis-and-Processing
Challenge 6 in the 4TH FUTURE-IOT PHD SCHOOL (https://school.future-iot.org/)
Teams:
BUCHI Baptiste,
TAKOUGANG Sylvain,
GARAH Abdelhamid,
MEHRI Hiba.

Goal : A tool to create engagement by processing in real time a keynote livestream to make content for social networks.

State of the art : “Ok google”, “Say Siri”, “Cortana”, …

Drawbacks :
⇒ Context more noisy (Harder to extract useful information)
⇒ More than one keyword
⇒ More than one speaker, with a variety accents
⇒ Indirect approach (We don’t listen to the speaker, but to a live recording of them)

Why using this tool ?
Attract new viewers, create more interactions in online keynotes
Trying to stay relevant in the age of social networks
Challenge the constraints of social distancing
